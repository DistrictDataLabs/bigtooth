    "## Introduction\n",
    "Bluetooth is one of many signal types that consistently permeate our daily lives. Every individual carrying a smartphone on their person has the ability to broadcast over Bluetooth -- and many individuals are broadcasting without knowing. This Fall 2016 District Data Labs Incubator project used this freely accessible information to assess patterns of life on a reoccurring commute to answer the basic question: how many strangers do I normally commute with?\n",
    "\n",
    "To accomplish this task we captured the timestamp and unique id of bluetooth sources along the same geographic route for 22 days. The project consists of a Raspberry Pi 3 loaded with Blue Hydra(https://github.com/pwnieexpress/blue_hydra). It uses a SENA UD100(https://www.amazon.com/Sena-UD100-Bluetooth-Class1-Adapter/dp/B01BHD7WR2) as the bluetooth adapter, the Raspbery Pi 3 onboard wifi, an Ubertooth dongle (not required. We eliminated noise from the dataset and found roughly YY% of the same individuals appeared along the route roughly ZZ% of the time.\n",

    "The following provides snippets of the most critical parts of our code, for the full thing please see our repository here (https://github.com/DistrictDataLabs/bigtooth).  Continued development of this code is taking place at (https://github.com/pcgeller/bigtooth). \n"

    "Protecting sensitive information is important and we have taken steps to obscure the data we collected; at no point was any individual subject to having their particular information leak out. Plus nearly all the information we collected consisted of what kind of device was being used, where it was being used, the time, and a unique Id for the device that allowed us to see individuals across time.\n",

    "In essence the data we collected is very similar in nature to wardriving (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wardriving).  A great deal of the research we were able to conduct about the legality of this activity pointed back to a passage that can be linked to a specific forum post on Politech.

These modes are standard services for any Bluetooth master to find slave devices.

    "## Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "The bigtooth project was designed to conduct pattern of life analysis using captured Bluetooth signals.  Pattern of life analysis is a technique used to create an activity profile for an individual or georgraphic area.  In this analysis an analyst will try to establish the *who, what, where, when, why* for a geographic area or individual.  This project focused on the pattern of life of a specific geographic area (the route) (*where*) and the inviduals that traversed the area (*who*) at specific times (*when*).  In order to track the who along the route the team first associated inviduals to a device.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This association was made through inductive reasoning.  The premise that a cell phone is typically owned and used by a single individual and the exceptions to this are rare should not be controversial.  To extend the premise futher; devices that are used with a cellular device are therefore also associated to an individual.  From these premises it can be strongly argued that some, but not all, Bluetooth signals can be associated with an individual person.  \n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned above this is not always the case. Some signals can be associated with devices that are stationary.  These devices are not associated with an indivdiual and more likely to be associated with a location.  In order to clean the data set these stationary devices were removed - how this was done will be dsicussed in greater detail under the data section."
