    "# Introduction\n",
    "Bluetooth is one of many signal types that consistently permeate our daily lives. Every individual carrying a smartphone on their person has the ability to broadcast over Bluetooth -- and many individuals are broadcasting without knowing. This Fall 2016 District Data Labs Incubator project used this freely accessible information to assess patterns of life on a reoccurring commute to answer the basic question: how many strangers do I normally commute with?\n",
    "\n",
    "To accomplish this task we captured the timestamp and unique id of bluetooth sources along the same geographic route for 22 days. The project consists of a Raspberry Pi 3 loaded with Blue Hydra(link). It uses a SENA UD100(link) as the bluetooth adapter, the RPI3(link?) onboard wifi, an Ubertooth dongle (not required. We eliminated noise from the dataset and found roughly YY% of the same individuals appeared along the route roughly ZZ% of the time.\n",
